Below are the requirements discussed in the meeting.
Initially we will start with the admission and registrations part. This includes regestering the students their groups and levels in which the groups study.
- Student can be individual or belong to a familly.
- There's a small fees paid annually for students:
  - Indivdual students pays X.
  - Familly students pay less. For example, first student pays X; the second member  pay X - d1; where d1 is the discount for the second member. Third members pays X - d2; where d2 is the discount for the third member and so on.
- As required by the government, reports needs to be shown for students payments.
  - Student total (paid vs. remaining).
  - Familly totals (paid vs. remaining).
  - Study Group members.
